# Heuristic optimisation algorithms
A simple implementation of finding shortest path using ant algorithm and genetic algorithm .

## Prerequisites
OpenCV is required for visualization.

## Build project
Build project with cmake:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
make
```

## Run project
Run greedy algorithm:
```
./greedy_algorithm
```
Run ant algorithm:
```
./ant_algorithm
```

Run genetic algorithm:
```
./genetic_algorithm
```
